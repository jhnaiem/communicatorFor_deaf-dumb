## Communicator For Deaf and Dumb

According to the Disability Welfare Act of 2001, disability is defined as physical or mental impairment resulting from various causes. This includes conditions such as hearing impairment and speech impairment. The prevalence of these disabilities globally is significant, affecting millions of people, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Lack of access to proper care and educational resources adds to the challenges faced by these individuals. In this context, our project aims to bridge the communication gap and improve the lives of people with hearing and speech impairments through technology.
